# TODO: Link Code Pages with Navbar

## Tasks
- [ ] Update navbar.jsx to use Link components from react-router-dom instead of anchor tags
- [ ] Add Shop route to App.jsx since shop.jsx component exists but no route
- [ ] Update navigation paths to match existing routes: / (Home), /about, /contact, /login
- [x] Test navigation works properly
